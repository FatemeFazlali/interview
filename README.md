Dishwash Dataset Exploration, Cleaning, and Analysis
Dataset:
The Dishwash dataset comprises information on sales, product tags, market tags, and period tags stored within a PostgreSQL database.

Steps Taken:
Data Exploration and Cleaning:

Handled missing values, outliers, and anomalies in the dataset.
Utilized seven different CSV and other file types; five were decompressed and merged to address the query.
Transformation based on Exploration:

Implemented hierarchical value transformations from the dataset.
Comprehensive documentation of the transformation process in the Jupyter Notebook.
Analysis:

Analyzed almost four years of data, spanning from 2018 to 2021.
Conducted comparative analysis across the dataset and added comparison infographics for the last two months.
Compiled a total report summarizing the findings gleaned from the analysis.
Top Distribution and Top Major:

Identified the primary distributors; assuming column 124 in the fact CSV file represents distributors, an analysis was conducted to find the top seller.
Incomplete data on product prices hindered the calculation of major contributors.
Produced a detailed dataframe focusing on sales, market impact, and product distribution, encompassing more than 7,000 product records.
